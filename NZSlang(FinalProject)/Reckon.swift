    var meaning: String = "n many ways it is a synonym for the word “think”, for example instead of saying “I think so” you could say “I reckon”. However it has other meanings: \n \n 1. Used to express one’s opinion. For example, instead of saying “Do you think?” you would say “Do you reckon?” \n \n Example: \n John: Do you reckon if I buy Jen a box of Pineapple Lumps (NZ Candy) and then ask her on a date she will say yes? \n Jack: Yeah, I reckon! (translation: yes, I think she will). \n \n 2. Used to agree enthusiastically to something. \n \n Example: \n John: I can’t believe the Blacks (rugby team) won for the 279th time! \n Jack: I reckon!(translation: I know!)."
