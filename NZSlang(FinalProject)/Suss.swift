To take care of a task that needs to be done or to sort something out. \n \n Example: \n John: You were supposed to get our rugby tickets sorted, suss it out bro! (translation: take care of it)\n Jack: Sussed it out this morning bro! (translation: I sorted it out this morning) \n \n 2. To describe something as suspicious/suspect.\n \n Example: \n John: Bro, it’s all good, this guy said he’ll give us a ride into town. \n Jack: Are you sure you wanna go with him? He looks kinda suss bro. (translation: he looks a bit suspicious/not right)."
