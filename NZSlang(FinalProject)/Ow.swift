    var meaning: String = "This can be combined with “Not even” and is used somewhat like an exclamation mark. It’s used quite sparingly, but if you manage to pull off the “Not even” + “Ow” combo as a foreigner, you will probably be made an honorary Kiwi. \n \n Example: /n Jack: Bro, how did you pass that exam, you must have cheated hardout! /n John: Not even ow! (translation: Get outa here)"
