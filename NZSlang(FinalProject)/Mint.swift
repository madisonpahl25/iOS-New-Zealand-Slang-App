    var meaning: String = "Loosely translates to “cool”, or “awesome”. Has quite a broad meaning and can be used to describe most things that you think are cool. \n \n Example: \n John: “Bro, check out my new iPhone cover, it’s got Kim Kardashian on the back.” \n Jack: “Gizza look. Oh bro, that is mint.” (translation: Give me a look. Oh man, that is awesome.)"
