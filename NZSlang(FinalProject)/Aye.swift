    var word: String = "Aye"
    var meaning: String = "It has many different uses so you will need to listen carefully to the pitch, tone and context in which it’s used to decipher the meaning in each particular situation. Also note that the word is pronounced like the letter “A”, not the letter I. \n \n 1. Used on the end of a statement to solicit agreement from the other party. Similar meaning to “don’t you think?” or “isn’t it?” \n \n Example: \n Jack: It’s pretty hot today aye? (translation: It’s pretty hot today, isn’t it?) \n John: Yeah bro, hardout. (translation: Yes, very). \n \n 2. Used to express disbelief and/or surprise. You would use a similar pitch and tone to when you say “Really??”. \n \n Example: \n Jack: Tim broke his leg at rugby last night and now he’s in the hospital. \n John: Aye? (translation: Really!?) \n \n 3. Used to express confusion when you’re unsure of why something is happening or when things are not appearing as they should. When used in this context the “Aye” will typically be longer and more drawn out, usually in a slightly higher pitched voice. \n \n Example: \n Jack: Bro Mr Tupai said you have to go to his office after school because your exam was so crap. \n John: Aaaaaye? (translation: What the hell!?) \n \n 4. Used as a filler word, with no real meaning at all. \n \n Example: \n Jack: How was Jen’s cupcake party? \n John: It was cool aye, I really enjoyed it."
