    var meaning: String = "Generally used in place of “cheers” or “thank you”, but in certain situations can also mean “OK/cool” or “No problem”. I’ve also heard people use it simply as a way to greet each other. /n /n Example: \n Jack: Saw you were running low bro so got you another beer.\n John: Chur bro! (translation: Thanks man)."
