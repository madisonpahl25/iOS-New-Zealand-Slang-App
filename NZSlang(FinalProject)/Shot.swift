    var meaning: String = "This has multiple meanings, so many that it would be pointless to explain them all here. Nonetheless, I encourage foreigners to try as often as possible. Three of the most common meanings are: \n \n 1. To express thanks. \n \n Example: \n Hey bro, can you pass me that jug of water please? Shot. (translation: Thanks) \n \n 2. To express joy, similar to how you might use “Yuss!!” \n \n Example: \n John: Bro, Jen got us free VIP tickets for Miley Cyrus tonight! \n Jack: Oh shot! (translation: That’s awesome!) \n \n 3. To express encouragement, or to say ‘good job’ or ‘well done’. \n \n Example: \n John: Hey bro, I finally passed my bikini waxing certification last night. Starting my new job tomorrow! \n Jack: Shot bro! (translation: Well done!)"
